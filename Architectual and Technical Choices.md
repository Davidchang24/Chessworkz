# Architectial and Technical Choices

This file contains the Architectual and Technical choices for the Chessworks project.

It includes the following topics:

- Architectural
  - Front-end framework
  - Back-end 
  - Microservices
  - Sprint boot
 
- Technical



## Architectual
### Front-end framework
For the front-end I will use a javascript framework. I have chosen React, why? It promises a fast learning curve and good performance, because it uses a virtual dom. It is also very well documented and maintained.

### Back-end
In the previous semesters I've used C# as the main language. This semester we had the choice to expand on that knowledge in 2 different ways. Dive deeper into C# or try something new. I've chosen for the ladder and gone with Java. 

### Microservices
To creating something that is called a distributed system, we need to build multiple small systems that have their own responsibility (that can run sepreatly from eachother). The microservice architecture holds that philosophy "Do one thing and do it well". In other words builds small, independent and self-contained services that are ready to go.
